MDN Rich Text Editor - practice purpose

***

# Features to be added

+ applying proper designing to the editor
+ adding more functional ability

***

# Reference
I was designing one of my project and then this idea came to my mind to make this editor more usable. As it is on core JavaScript, it has more ability to perform on the foundation level.

Link to this is present here: [MDN-Rich Text Editor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Editable_content/Rich-Text_Editing_in_Mozilla)

# Note
Anyone can contribute to it to make it good at there level.
Thanks.
